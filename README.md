# Library_Management_Project
The Library Management System is a Django-based web application designed to manage books, authors, and borrowing histories. It provides functionality for adding, updating, and deleting books, as well as tracking borrowing activities. This project uses Django REST Framework for building APIs and PostgreSQL as the database.
